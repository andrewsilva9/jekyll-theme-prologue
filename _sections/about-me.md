I am currently a Research Scientist I in the CORE lab at Georgia Tech under professor Matthew Gombolay, soon to be starting as PhD student in the same lab. I graduated with my Master's of CS from Georgia Tech, specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning and robotics, and the ways that interactive intelligence can be improved and leveraged for a variety of tasks.

I also spent half a year traveling around the globe, which you can read more about at my travel blog: [https://asilvatravels.wordpress.com](https://asilvatravels.wordpress.com)
