I am a first year PhD student the CORE Robotics lab at Georgia Tech under professor Matthew Gombolay, formerly a Research Scientist in the same lab and in the RAIL lab with Dr. Sonia Chernova. I graduated with my Master's of CS from Georgia Tech, specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning and robotics, and the ways that interactive intelligence can be improved and leveraged for a variety of tasks, specifically around low-data situations and multi-modal or contextual problems.

I also spent half a year traveling around the globe, which you can read more about at my travel blog: [https://asilvatravels.wordpress.com](https://asilvatravels.wordpress.com)
