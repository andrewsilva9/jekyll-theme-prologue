I am currently a Research Scientist I in the RAIL lab at Georgia Tech under professor Sonia Chernova. I recently graduated with my Master's of CS from Georgia Tech, specializing in Computational Perception and Robotics. I'm interested in the intersection of machine learning and robotics, and the ways that robot perception and interactive intelligence can be improved.

I also spent half a year traveling around the globe, which you can read more about at my travel blog: [https://asilvatravels.wordpress.com](https://asilvatravels.wordpress.com)
