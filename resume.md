### Experience

***
#### Research Scientist I, Georgia Tech
Atlanta, GA
May 2017 -- Present

I work as a research scientist in the [RAIL lab](http://www.rail.gatech.edu), primarily on bringing deep learning perception methods to robots. While here, I have:

* Wrapped several state of the art deep networks in ROS for deployment to an autonomous robot.
* Published a [new ROS package](http://wiki.ros.org/rail_face_detector) for real time face detection using a deep network, and improved [an existing ROS package](http://wiki.ros.org/rail_object_detector) for real time object detection.
* Conducted two user studies to evaluate the performance of an experimental algorithm against a random baseline
* Helped write and submit a workshop paper, two conference papers, and a journal paper.
* Used deep networks to create video embeddings for a zero-shot learning project.

#### GTA, Georgia Tech
Atlanta, GA
August 2016 -- September 2017

I worked as a TA for CS 6476, Intro to Computer Vision, helping about 200 students through the OMSCS program. As a TA for the course, I would host office hours, answer student questions online, and grade assignments.

***
#### Applications Developer, AT&T
Atlanta, GA
June 2014 -- December 2015

Within AT&T I worked primarily on two separate teams, CDI (Concept Development Innovation) and TDP (Technology Development Program). The CDI team focuses on working with new technologies and experimenting, and the TDP team focuses on developing new employees and helping people to train in new technologies for a changing future. While there, I:

* Wrote a library for Android devices to work with Apple iBeacons
* Oversaw the Atlanta internship program, helping to manage 40 summer interns
* Presented and developed a job search platform for employees seeking new opportunities within the company.
