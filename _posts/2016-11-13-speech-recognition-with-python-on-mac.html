Setting up speech recognition and transcription on a Mac is surprisingly easy using Python. I'm using Python 3.5, but the library I'll be using works for 2.7 and 3.x.<br /><br />First you'll need to have homebrew, which you can find <a href="http://brew.sh/">here</a>. Homebrew is an excellent package manager for Mac, and makes it easy to install a better version of Python than what comes bundled with the Mac.<br /><br />Once you have homebrew (and the Python installation of your choice) open up a terminal and run:<br /><br /><code>brew install portaudio </code><br /><code><br /></code>This installs the requirement for the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SpeechRecognition/">Speech Recognition library</a> for Python. Afterwards, you can run: <br /><code>pip install pyaudio </code><br />And finally: <br /><code>pip install SpeechRecognition </code><br />And you have the requirements in place! You can test it out by running: <br /><code>python -m speech_recognition&nbsp;</code><br /> And you should see it working in your terminal. <br />To get it up and running in your own Python script is also very easy. Here is an example using your built-in microphone and the Google Speech API:<br /><br /><code>import speech_recognition as sr</code><br /><code>rec = sr.Recognizer()&nbsp;</code><br /><code>with sr.Microphone() as source:&nbsp;</code><br /><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; print("I'm listening!")</code><br /><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; audio = rec.listen(source=source)&nbsp;</code><br /><code><br /></code><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; try:&nbsp;</code><br /><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transcription = rec.recognize_google(audio)</code><br /><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; except sr.UnknownValueError:&nbsp;</code><br /><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transcription = "Google Speech API is confused"&nbsp;</code><br /><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; except sr.RequestError as e:&nbsp;</code><br /><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; transcription = "Request to Google Speech API failed, request error: ", e&nbsp;</code><br /><code>&nbsp; &nbsp; print(transcription) </code><br /><code><br /></code>It's that simple!
