Code for the front-end project is publicly <a href="https://github.com/andrewsilva9/disciples-of-iaso">available here</a>. Fair warning, without the data pipeline plugged into the backend, it doesn't run properly (so if you want to edit it to your liking, you'll need to put up your own data).<br /><br />As a final project for a course in Health Informatics, I got together with a group and we built a platform that would allow people to examine gaps in care across different healthcare providers and conditions. If you were a diabetic and had the choice between Physician A and Physician B, there could be value in knowing that A's patients on average are 30% healthier than B's patients over the past 6 months (for example). We set out to build a web app that could do exactly that.<br /><br />The site itself was relatively simple to setup. Thanks to a helpful boilerplate app from a site called <a href="http://www.startangular.com/">Start Angular</a>, we had a base platform up in no time, and were on our way to get the app together. We gutted the platform and set about to building it out the way we needed it. Setting up the options to work together with our backend was trivial, though we did run into some issues later with data flow for our backend (more on that in a bit).<br /><br />The basic structure of the front-end is very straightforward. Users select a condition, which has a commonplace name (like Diabetes) and a coded name (like HBA1C). The next selection is a start and end date for the data comparison, and finally the choice between available providers for that condition and time period. The choices are all dynamically populated with the data that we pull in from our Node backend.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pVGdRCgpo0w/WCIgvTy6AyI/AAAAAAAAB7Y/T6KUdQYwEFw8gIqqUmS99jLXf3p25bWsgCK4B/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-11-08%2Bat%2B1.59.23%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pVGdRCgpo0w/WCIgvTy6AyI/AAAAAAAAB7Y/T6KUdQYwEFw8gIqqUmS99jLXf3p25bWsgCK4B/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2016-11-08%2Bat%2B1.59.23%2BPM.png" width="100%" /></a>
